The program from part 3 is a program that will tell the user what the
potential energy of an object is.  The user inputs the mass and height of the
object and is then given the potential energy.

The program is structured by initializing the float variable m, which is 
for mass, then asking the user to input a value for mass.  If the user inputs
a negative number or a 0 then the program will end because mass cannot be
negative or 0. The same process is then done for the variable h, which is
for height, since height cannot be negative. The float variable pe is then 
initialized and is set equal to m*h*9.81, which is the formula for 
potential energy. The program then outputs "The potential energy of the object
is: **(whatever the value is)** joules.

I evaluated it for correctness by inputting negative numbers and 0 for mass
and inputting negative numbers for h.  Also, I tried multiple times with
different positive numbers, not only integers, and checked the program's
solution using a calculator.
