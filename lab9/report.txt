Tommy Lynch report for crossword.cpp 

First off, I know this lab is incomplete, I just got as much done as I could before I had to stop because of family stuff.  I did not have time to make it so that the puzzle would input words within each other like an actual crossword, so I just had them input the words randomly.  The program starts off by initializing a structure called crossword that has two arrays of chars, one is the board that will have the answers, and one is the board with the spaces for the user to play the game.  I also have two vectors of strings, one is the words that the user enters, sorted by length and the other is the randomly shuffled strings sorted in the same fashion.  I also have a struct for comparing the length of strings, which I use to sort the vectors by length. In the main, I only used functions.  in initialize() the program initializes the boards of results and the playable board.  input() asks the users for words and then sorts the words and randomizes them accordingly.  outputboard() outputs the playable board, and outputresults() outputs the results board, where all of the words are displayed in the board. outputanswers() outputs the shuffled words which are used as clues to the user.

The user runs the program and is asked to enter up to 20 words and a '.' when done.  After the user does this, the results board and the playable board are displayed followed by the clues.

I did not do much testing for this since it is incomplete, I just tested out what would happen if I entered words longer than 15 characters or if I tried to enter more than 20 words, and the program cuts it off after 20.
