The final part of the assignment is the ASCII Art Graph.  To the user, this program is not interactive, the user just runs the program and then he or she sees ta list of x and y values with a sideways plot of the x and y values.  At the bottom of the list the user sees the minimum and maximum values for y and at what x value those y values were at.

The program works using a nested for loop with two if statements.  The outer for loop is the loop that assigns values to y for the x value of that loop and then the program goes into an if statement that tests to see if the y value is the highest y value yet, then another if statement to see if the y value is the lowest yet. After the if statements, the program outputs the x and y values, which were set to 2 decimal places.  Then the program enters another for loop, which is used to make the actual graph.  The for loop starts at 0 and goes until the counter is equal to y so that the amount of #'s is equal to the integer of the rounded up Y value. After this for loop the program exits both for loops and then just outputs the min and max values of x and y.

I verified the correctness of the program by plugging the function into a graphing calculator and comparing values.  The values matched up so I concluded that the program worked correctly.
